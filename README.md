## 🗺️ Roadmap
We're planning to bring some exciting new features in HIPPOSITE 2! Here's what's in the works:  

- 🕹️ **Games Tab**  
  - Find a bakers dozen (or more!) games to waste your time away.

- 📂 **Utilities**  
  - A guide on bookmarklets, (even after they're blocked!) Terraos, and more.

- 🚪 **Alternate methods**  
  - More efficient, cooler, and simple methods to deliver your blocked websites.

- 🛠️ **ExtFlood3r Integration**  
  - A tool made by [Blobby-Boi](https://github.com/Blobby-Boi)   (ExtFlood3r [repo](https://github.com/Blobby-Boi/ExtFlood3r)  ) to disable blocking extensions. (check [here](https://github.com/philchhalmers8/Hipposite/blob/main/extensionslist.png) for extensions list)

- 🔄 **Auto-Update**  
  - Remove the unnecessary manual updates, and deliver the newest content in seconds. *COMPLETE*

- And countless other ideas and possibilities. Stay tuned [at our discord](https://discord.com/channels/1282151040183046237/1301178045142667305) to learn more.

## 📱 Apps

- **Reddit** | *Not guaranteed either*

- **Spotify**  

### And Many others!
